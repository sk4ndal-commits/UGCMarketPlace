## 🏗️ System Architecture – CollabMarket MVP

---

## 🧩 Architectural Principles

- **Modular and layered:** Clear separation between API, frontend, and
  background services.
- **Scalable:** Ready to evolve into microservices as platform grows.
- **Secure and compliant:** GDPR-ready, with secure authentication and payment
  handling.
- **API-first:** Backend designed as a REST API to support future mobile and
  partner apps.

## 📂 Core Backend Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Auth Service** | User registration, login, roles, password reset, OAuth. |
| **Campaign Service** | CRUD operations for UGC briefs, filtering, status management. |
| **Application Service** | Handling influencer applications, selection, and notifications. |
| **Messaging Service** | 1:1 chat, notifications, file attachments (future). |
| **Payment Service** | Escrow, payout workflow, refunds, transaction records. |
| **Content Delivery Service** | Content uploads, approvals, revision requests. |
| **Admin Module** | User moderation, dispute resolution, analytics dashboard. |

---

## 🔄 Data Flow (Example: Campaign Application)

1. **Brand** creates a UGC campaign via frontend.  
2. Campaign data → Backend API → Stored in PostgreSQL.  
3. **Influencers** retrieve campaign list → Apply with pitch and price.  
4. Application stored → Notification to brand.  
5. **Brand** reviews → Accepts → Payment escrow initiated.  
6. **Influencer** delivers content → Brand approves → Payment released.  

---

## 📊 Security & Compliance

- HTTPS enforced on all endpoints.  
- JWT tokens with refresh and expiration.  
- GDPR-compliant user data management.  
- Stripe PCI-compliant payment flow.  
- Rate limiting & CSRF protection enabled.

---

## 📈 Scaling Path (Post-MVP)

| Layer | Future Evolution |
|-------|------------------|
| Backend | Split into microservices (Auth, Messaging, Payments). |
| Messaging | Dedicated WebSocket service (Node.js or Go). |
| Analytics | Event pipeline (Kafka + ClickHouse). |
| Search | Elasticsearch for complex influencer queries. |
| Frontend | Native mobile apps using API. |

## 🧪 Monitoring & Observability
- Logging: Django logging + ELK stack  
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana  
- Error tracking: Sentry  
- Uptime: Health checks + status endpoint  

---

## ✅ Key Architecture Goals
- Support 10k+ active users with <300 ms API response time.
- Deliver MVP backend within 8–10 weeks.
- Ensure architecture is extensible without major refactoring.
- Ready for future multi-language and multi-region support.
