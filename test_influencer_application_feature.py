Test script for Feature #3: Influencer ‚Äì Browse & Apply to Campaigns

This script tests all acceptance criteria:
1. Influencer can filter campaigns by budget, category, platform, deadline
2. Application form allows short text pitch and optional portfolio link
3. Influencer can propose a price (if not fixed)
4. Application confirmation email is sent

Constraints tested:
- Cannot apply to expired campaigns
- Cannot apply to same campaign twice
